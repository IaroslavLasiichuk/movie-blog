# Movie Dudes Application

## Description: 
 The application allows users to search for movies based on title. The application also allows for the user to register to our app to save movies watched, comment, and read critic reviews.


## User story
```md
As a user, I want to be able to retrieve and add new data using a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js. 

The API should use Handlebars.js as the template engine, 
MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database, and have both GET and POST routes. 

The API should also use at least one new library or technology, follow the MVC paradigm folder structure, and include authentication using express-session and cookies.

Additionally, the API must protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables, be deployed on Heroku with data, have a polished UI that is responsive and interactive, meet good-quality coding standards, and have a professional README with a unique name, description, and link to the deployed app.
 ```
